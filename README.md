# Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning in MySQL

## Project Overview
This project involved exploratory data analysis and data cleaning using MySQL as part of a YouTube bootcamp course. 

## Tools Used
- MySQL

## Project Steps
1. Data Collection: Collected dataset from Kaggle.

2. Data Cleaning: 
  During this phase, I focused on improving the quality of the dataset by:
  - Removing duplicates
  - Handling missing values and NULL
  - Standardizing data formats
  - Ensuring consistency across columns
  These steps were crucial in preparing the data for analysis, leading to more accurate insights and visualizations.

3. Exploratory Analysis:
  In this phase, I used MySQL to:
  - Run descriptive statistics on key columns
  - Identify patterns, outliers, and correlations through SQL queries
  - Analyze trends within the dataset
  These insights helped deepen my understanding of the data for more informed decision-making. 

## Key Findings
  ### Key Findings from Data Cleaning
  - Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
  - Successfully handled missing values by applying appropriate methods, such as removing or filling them.
  - Standardized inconsistent data formats, leading to cleaner, more reliable datasets for further analysis.
  
  ### Key Findings from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Detected patterns in the data that highlighted important trends.
  - Identified outliers that could have distorted the results if not addressed.
  - Found correlations between key variables, providing insights into relationships within the dataset.
